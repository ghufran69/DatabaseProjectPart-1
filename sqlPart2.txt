1. Definition and Purpose of the SELECT Statement:

The SELECT statement is a fundamental command in SQL used to retrieve data from a database. It allows users to view information stored in tables without modifying the data. By using SELECT, we can display all records in a table, retrieve specific columns, or filter results based on conditions. The main purpose of SELECT is data retrieval, which helps users analyze, search, and understand stored information.

2. Examples of Basic SELECT Queries

Example 1: Display all records from a table

SELECT * FROM book;

Explanation:
This query displays all columns and all rows from the table named book. The asterisk (*) means “select everything.”

Example 2: Display specific columns
SELECT bookTitle, price FROM book;
Explanation:
This query retrieves only the book title and price columns instead of the entire table.

Example 3: Display data from another table
SELECT MfullName, MemberEmail FROM members;
Explanation:
This query shows the names and emails of members, focusing only on relevant information.


3. Examples of WHERE, ORDER BY, and DISTINCT

WHERE Example
SELECT * FROM book
WHERE price > 10;
Explanation:
This query retrieves only books with a price greater than 10. The WHERE clause filters results based on a condition.
ORDER BY Example
SELECT * FROM book
ORDER BY price DESC;
Explanation:
This query sorts books by price in descending order, meaning from highest to lowest.

DISTINCT Example:

SELECT DISTINCT bookGener FROM book;
Explanation:
This query shows unique values of book genres without repeating duplicates.

4. Why SELECT is Fundamental to SQL
The SELECT statement is fundamental because retrieving data is the primary purpose of a database. Organizations store large amounts of data, and SELECT allows users to search, analyze, and generate useful information from that data. Without SELECT, databases would only store information but not provide a way to access or use it effectively.
